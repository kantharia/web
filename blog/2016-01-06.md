Today we have released [.Net/C# client library](/download/net-c) for emitter. This library is based on a great M2MQTT library written by [Paolo Patierno](https://m2mqtt.wordpress.com/who/), we have integrated emitter.io specific features and expanded support for various .Net Frameworks. 

Here's a quick summary of features supported by this new library:
 * No external dependencies.
 * Multi-target nuget package.
 * Subscription matching
 * Support .Net Micro-Framework.
 * Support for older .Net Frameworks.
 * Support for Mono runtime

### No External Dependencies

The library itself is very lightweight and depends only on `mscorlib` and `System.dll` (or equivalent) which means that you'll only need to have `Emitter.dll` added as a reference to your project to make this work. 

### Nuget Package

Nuget package build which auto-targets a specific framework. A single package to rule them all!

### Subscription Matching

The library also features tree matching, this allows you to subscribe to a particular topic and attach a handler directly to it, as allustrated below:

```
emitter.On(channelKey, "chat/+/english", (channel, msg) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(msg));
});
```

Once a message is received which matches the handler channel (e.g.: `chat/roman/english`), the handler will be invoked by the client library. If you have several handlers which match the same message, all of them will be invoked.

### Micro Frameworks

The client library supports .Net Micro-Framework (4.2, 4.3 & 4.4) for embedded development, so you can program your favourite programmable board such as [Netduino](http://www.netduino.com/netduino3/).

### Older .Net Frameworks

Older .Net Frameworks are supported, starting from Framework 2.0. This is to support [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/) development and the ability to enhance your legacy applications with some advanced real-time networking.

### Mono Support

Because we love Mono and embrace cross-platform development. This was simply a must to have for us.
