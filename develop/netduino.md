### Overview

Netduino uses .Net Micro Framework and our C# library currently supports .Net Micro Framework 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. This library provides a nicer MQTT interface fine-tuned and extended with specific features provided by [emitter.io](http://emitter.io). The library is based upon the [M2MQTT library](http://www.m2mqtt.net
) written by [Paolo Patierno](https://m2mqtt.wordpress.com/who/) and released under Eclipse Public License.

### Build Notes
